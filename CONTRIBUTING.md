# Contributing to Duskfall

Duskfall is my own personal project which I intend to work on indefinitely - however, as many of my favourite games are more
enjoyable with mods, I welcome suggestions and contributions from anyone who enjoys the Duskfall project! If you're interested in
contributing to Duskfall, here are the things to bear in mind:

1. **Be cool.** I can't stress this one enough. We're all friends here, so please behave. More specifically, I expect everyone
interacting with this project on GitHub to abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Gravecat/Duskfall/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

2. This project is open-source (licensed under the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)), so you are of course
welcome to take the existing code, modify it to your heart's content, and release your own modified versions of what you think the
game should be like! With that in mind, I'm *very* open to suggestions and improvements, and I'd be much happier working with fans
of the game to include new features and changes you folks think would be cool. While I reserve the right to have the final word in
what is (or is not) included in this official main branch of Duskfall, you're still free to make and release your own mods or
modded versions.

3. I have lots of ideas for this project; probably more than I'll ever have time to implement. If you think you have a great idea
for something to add to it, please feel free to contact me first - either here on GitHub or via email at raine@moxx.net - as it's
entirely possible I may already be working on something similar to what you have in mind, or have plans to implement something of
the sort in the future. I'd much rather work with folks in expanding the game together, rather than people writing code only to
discover I've already started coding the same feature.

So with that in mind, you want to contribute? Great! Here's a few ways you can do that!

* Head to the [issues page](https://github.com/Gravecat/Duskfall/issues), do a quick search to see if the bug report or feature
suggestion you have in mind is already there, and if not, go ahead and open a new issue. I personally review everything posted on
the issues page, and I especially welcome reports of bugs I'm unaware of! :)

* Fork or clone the Duskfall repository and start tinkering! I'm open to any reasonable [pull requests](https://github.com/Gravecat/Duskfall/pulls),
though as mentioned above, I reserve the right to personally decide which content makes it into the main build of the game. If in
doubt, feel free to shoot me an email with your suggestions first. Please ensure that you target the 'contrib' branch with pull
requests, *not* the 'master' branch.

* I plan on keeping Duskfall free and open-source forever; I'm working on this project because I love coding and want to make a
great game! With that said, I have a [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/gravecat) where I will gratefully accept any donations towards
the game's development. I don't currently have a Patreon, but may open one at some point in the future if there is enough interest.

* If you enjoy Duskfall, tell your friends about it! :)
