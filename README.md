# Duskfall

Duskfall is a roguelike in development by Raine "Gravecat" Simmons, copyright (c) 2016-2019. (The Duskfall project itself began in October 2019, however large parts of its code were salvaged from an older personal project, [Krasten](https://github.com/Gravecat/Duskfall/wiki/Krasten).)

The game is free and open-source, released under the [GNU General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). I welcome anyone to submit bugfixes, improvements or additions to the game, but do please bear in mind this is my personal project and I reserve the right to have the last word on what is and is not included in the 'official' release of the game. You are of course welcome to build and release your own version, however any changes must also be released under the GPLv3. See the [license file](https://github.com/Gravecat/Duskfall/blob/master/LICENSE) for the full legal details, and the [contribution guidelines page](https://github.com/Gravecat/Duskfall/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further details.
